# Civet
A Lightweight Pipeline Framework

## *NOTE*
While Civet has served us well since 2013, there are now many alternatives 
that may be better suited for your needs. Currently Civet only receives 
infrequent maintenance updates. We are considering adding SLURM support 
in the near future but longer-term we may consider community-supported 
alternatives as a replacement for Civet.

If you do attempt to install Civet in your local HPC environment, please
note the requirements and disclaimer below. We are unable to offer support 
for HPC environments that differ from ours.

## Overview
Civet is a framework for developing command line analysis pipelines 
that execute through a batch system on High Performance 
Computing (HPC) systems.  Currently only the TORQUE* resource manager is 
supported, but others may be supported in the future. 

***Note** As of June 2018, new releases of TORQUE are no longer 
open-source software and are available only for purchase from 
Adaptive Computing. Source code for previous versions of TORQUE are 
still available on Github: https://github.com/adaptivecomputing/torque

A Civet pipeline is defined by an XML file that describes the files 
operated on by the pipeline (the files can be input from the user, 
produced by a step in the pipeline, or may be hard coded reference 
files) and the steps that act on the files. Each tool that may be 
invoked by the pipeline is defined by its own XML file. These tool 
definitions may be shared between pipelines, allowing multiple 
pipelines to make use of a common set of tools.

Civet operates entirely in the user space, and can be installed 
without administrator permissions. It leverages the batch system's job 
dependency features to control pipeline execution. Pipeline flow is 
fixed at submission time; conditional branching is not supported.

See the documentation in the docs subdirectory for more information 
about the framework.

## Installation

### Requirements
Currently only the [TORQUE resource manager](https://github.com/adaptivecomputing/torque) is supported, but others may be supported in the future.

Civet has been tested with several versions of Python 2.7.  It has not
been tested with Python 3, but there are potentially some 
incompatibilities. We have slowly been making the code more Python 3 
friendly and plan to officially support Python 3 in the future.

Civet uses one Python module that is not part of a standard Python 2.7
installation: `pbs_python`. This module can be obtained from 
https://oss.trac.surfsara.nl/pbs_python and must be installed before 
you can use Civet.

### Disclaimer
Weâ€™ve provided this software with the hopes that others may find it useful.
However, this software may not work (and in fact will likely not work for you
as-is) if your HPC environment differs significantly from ours. 

### Installing Civet
To install civet, you simply need a copy of the Civet source code. We 
typically clone the git repository into a directory named after the 
version we are installing: `/prefix/civet/version` and do a 
`git checkout version` in that directory.  You would then add 
`/prefix/civet/version/bin` to your PATH and 
`/prefix/civet/version/lib` to your PYTHONPATH. We use Environment
Modules (http://modules.sourceforge.net/) to setup the user's 
environment for Civet.
